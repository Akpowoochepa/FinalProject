# Structure in Academic Writing 
Academic writing should have a clear, logical structure to effectively communicate points and show connections between them.
To build points on each other, we can use a linear structure avoiding backward and forward jumps.

## Steps to structure your documents
* Place relevant/important information first, ensuring everything relates to the main argument or point of the paragraph.
* Use cohesion to join ideas and points clearly
* Begin with a good plan,outlining your argument and main points in a logical order.
* Organize similar points into groups and arragne these groups logically.
* Within each group, organize the points logically and check the plan against task requirements​​.

## Paragraph Structure 
* Each paragraph should contain one main point or idea, with all information relevant to the point.
* Include a topic sentence showing the main point, followed by the body of the paragraph integrating development of the point, evidence, and critical analysis.
* Conclude with a wrao up linking to the overall argument or the next paragraph.

## Complexity and Higher-Order Thinking
* Address complex issues requiring critical, reflective, logical, and creative thinking.
* Summarize complex information into a well-organized synthesis of ideas, concepts, and recommendations​

# Common Mistakes to Avoid 
* Avoid excessive or inappropriate use of specialized terminology.
* Limit the use of personal nouns, avoid informal tone, wordiness, vague expressions, and overuse of lists.
* Focus on methodology, analysis, and interpretation of findings rather than excessive descriptive writing.
