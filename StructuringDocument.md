# Structure in Academic Writing 
Academic writing should have a clear, logical structure to effectively communicate points and show connections between them.
To build points on each other, we can use a linear structure avoiding backward and forward jumps.

## Steps to structure your documents
* Place relevant/important information first, ensuring everything relates to the main argument or point of the paragraph.
* Use cohesion to join ideas and points clearly
