# Structure in Academic Writing 
Academic writing should have a clear, logical structure to effectively communicate points and show connections between them.
To build points on each other, we can use a linear structure avoiding backward and forward jumps.

## Steps to structure your documents
* Place relevant/important information first, ensuring everything relates to the main argument or point of the paragraph.
* Use cohesion to join ideas and points clearly
* Begin with a good plan,outlining your argument and main points in a logical order.
* Organize similar points into groups and arragne these groups logically.
* Within each group, organize the points logically and check the plan against task requirements​​.
