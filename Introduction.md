# Introduction to Academic Writing

Academic writing involves conveying ideas, making arguments, and engaging in scholarly conversation. It is characterized by evidence-based arguments, precise word choice, logical organization, and an impersonal tone.

## Examples of academic writing
* Literary Analysis: "An essay that examines and interprets various elements of a literary work, such as theme, character, and plot."
* Research Papers: "A detailed study or investigation conducted on a specific topic, utilizing data and evidence to support a thesis or argument."
* Dissertations: "A substantial piece of academic writing based on original research, typically submitted as part of a doctoral degree."

## Key characteristics of academic writing
 * Clear and limited focus
 * logical structure
 * Evidence-based arguments: This involves supporting your claims with data, scholarly articles, and reliable sources to lend credibility to your arguments.
 * An impersonal tone.

## Thesis Statement
The thesis is crucial in academic writing, serving as the central argument and focus of the paper. It should be clear, concise, and consistently referenced throughout the writing process.

Example of a Thesis Statement: "This paper explores the impact of social media on mental health, arguing that excessive use of social media can lead to increased feelings of anxiety and isolation among teenagers."

## Mistakes to avoid 
Mistakes in academic writing include
* wordiness - The goal of academic writing is to convey complex ideas in a clear, concise manner.
* vague or missing thesis statements - the thesis statement must be clear, and each body paragraph needs to tie into that thesis.
* informal language - Academic writing is formal in tone and should not include slang, idioms, or conversational language.
* failure to cite sources properly - Keep track of your source materials throughout the research and writing process.
